<h2>Where We're Going We Won't Need Employment</h2>

The time has finally come to take the plunge.  Tomorrow I will be giving my two weeks notice and begin the end of my six year tenure as a Mechanical Engineer.  I will be attending a Code Fellows 301 course in Seattle to formally begin my path to a new career in software development.

<h2>Are you Mad?</h2>

Not any more!  Committing to this life decision has been nothing short of liberating.  The question I had to ask myself seriously was, "Why would you give up a successful career to pursue something else entirely?"

In a word, complacency.  In my six years as a Mech E, I've had two jobs.  The first as a program engineer at the Bangor Naval Base and the second as an aerospace Tooling Design Engineer at Electroimpact.  While there was plenty to enjoy about each job, after a time I found myself restless, listless, and complacent.  The challenges had been figured out, bodies of knowledge acquired, and future prospects examined.  In both cases, I could see a career path that would be comfortable.  My most successful colleagues and peers had found a niche, become an expert, and would relentlessly churn out iterations of the same tools (with great skill) ad nauseum.  Its impossible not to respect the quality of their work and their dedication, but I know that I function best when presented with new challenges, fresh perspectives, and opportunities to learn and expand knowledge.

Before committing to this career change I was a bit mad.  I was upset that I was complacent - that I wasn't pushing myself to learn more and innovate.  I was frustrated that I couldn't find the same joy in my work that my peers could.  Now, though, I am thrilled by new opportunities to learn and test myself.

<h2>Why Software Development?</h2>

Many reasons.  Chief among them is the relatively fevered pace of innovation and progress.  In the mechanical world large projects can take years to complete and new technologies (while amazing) require huge amounts of resources and time to develop.

The software industries, relatively speaking, are still emerging from their infancy.  As a result, innovation is constant - empowered by an open source culture dedicated to sharing knowledge and resources.  The barriers for an entrepreneurial spark to catch fire are much lower.  Good ideas don't require massive capital investments to become reality.  This is what appeals to me.  There is always something to learn and always a new problem to solve.

<h2>The Master Plan</h2>

Here are the major components of my preparation strategy:
1. Prepare for and complete the Codefellows bootcamp.
2. Develop additional skills and knowledge through self-study.
3. Develop a portfolio of personal projects as proof of technical skill.
4. Prepare for interviews by regularly completing interview-style challenge problems in multiple languages.

<h3>1. Codefellows Bootcamp</h3>
[Codefellows][] is a four course bootcamp with locations in Seattle, Redmond, and Portland that has a good reputation in industry.  Additionally, the school has a money-back guarantee for finding you a job and makes an effort to network with local companies to make placement easier.  Codefellows focuses on web-based development technologies.

Since I have some prior experience, I tested into the 301 level course beginning Oct 24th.

<h3>2. Self Study</h3>
In order to prepare for the bootcamp and develop relevant skills, I've been doing self-study utilizing a variety of resources around the web.

Introductory courses (a great place to get started):
1. [Coursera Specialization - Python for Everybody][1]

2. [Codeacademy - HTML/CSS and Javascript courses][2]

3. [Udemy - Console Foundations][3]

4. [GitHub tutorial][4]

Continuing education (focusing on greater software dev concepts beyond language syntax):
1. [Data Structures and Algorithms][5]

2. [Machine Structures][6]

3. [Operating Systems][7]

4. [Computer Networking][8]

<h3>3. Develop a Portfolio</h3>
The best way to get paid for programming, is to do a bunch of it for free for yourself.  Companies care more about experience and your ability to produce something than an education.  To that end, I'm creating a portfolio to showcase things I've built.  Before I start applying for jobs, my hope is to complete the following things:

* A website with a blog (as a means to prove my web development abilities and host my portfolio online)
* At least one simple Android application (currently have plans to write a simple alarm clock app).
* A more complicated Android application that will be completed with friends (serves the dual purposes of being a part of a more complicated project and proving my ability to work with a development team).

<h3>4. Interview Preparation</h3>
Interviews in the tech industry are notoriously difficult - know for constantly testing specific technical knowledge and problem solving methods and abilities.  In order to better prepare I am utilizing the following resources:

1. [Reddit Daily Programmer Challenges][9] (Complete 2 - 3 of these per week, try to use multiple languages)
2. [Cracking the Coding Interview][10] (Famous Book)
3. Complete various coding challenges around the web (e.g. [Hacker Rank][11] and [30 Days of Coding][12])
