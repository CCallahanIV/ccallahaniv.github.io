  <h2 id="contentTitle">self-improvement is an iterative process</h2>
  <p>This website is my attempt to prove to myself that a lapsed Mechanical Engineer can find new purpose through passion for technology, thirst for new challenges, and severe allergic reactions to complacency.</p>

  <p>I believe that life's many challenges are opportunities to improve yourself.  The experience and knowledge gained from each new test is a means to iteratively create a better self.  My hope is that by constantly challenging myself I can continually improve.</p>
